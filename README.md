# bachelor thesis

Senior thesis I submitted for my Bachelor of Science in Specialized Chemistry at
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (2020).

Thesis was submitted at commit `ac08fbd`. However, this thesis will continue to
be edited and updated until I deem it complete, because I am proud of my work
and wish to perfect it.
